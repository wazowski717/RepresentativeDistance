# RepresentativeDistance
Code related to economic research investigating how the 'distance' between representatives and their constituents affects economic volatility. The code constructs a unique database containing state demographic and Congressional data for given years/sessions of congress.

The code begins by scraping data on senators/representatives from each congress. It then combines this data with a database containing biographical info of senators found on OSU libraries. Lastly, it takes this combined dataset and merges it with a dataset containing demographic data for each state for given years.
